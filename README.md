## API Design

`/getData` endpoint to fetch the data and set it in local storage.

`/setData` to update the data in local storage.

For adding Adding, Updating and Deleting the data we can create the APIs.

For update and delete API we need a unique value like **ID** in the data with which we can identify the record we want to update / delete.

### UPDATED DATA FORMAT:
``` bash
{
    id: number,
    type: string,
    position: number,
    title: string,
    src: string
}
```

`/updateData` will be the endpoint which will update the existing data using the **ID** and in the request we will send the **ID** of the record we want to update and the updated data.

`/deleteData` will be the endpoint which will delete the record using **ID** and in the request we will send the **ID** of the record we want to delete.
