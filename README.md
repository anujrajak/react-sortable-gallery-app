## API Design

### UPDATED DATA FORMAT:
``` bash
{
    id: number,
    title: string,
    type: string,
    position: number,
    src: string
}
```

For delete API we need a unique value like **ID** in the data with which we can identify the record we want to delete.

`/api/entries` endpoint to fetch the all the data from PostgreSQL DB sorted by position.

`/api/create` will be the endpoint which will add the new data and in the request we will send the new data we want to add to DB.

`/api/update` will be the endpoint which will update the existing data in DB and in the request we will send the data we want to update.

`/api/delete/{id}` will be the endpoint which will delete the record using **ID** and in the request we will send the **ID** of the record we want to delete.
